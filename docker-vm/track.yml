title: Sandbox virtual machine
teaser: Use a virtual machine (VM) as a sandbox host
description: |-
  Testing! Again :-)
  A sandbox host can be a container or a virtual machine (VM).

  One reason to choose a VM over a container is if you need access to
  the Docker daemon to build and run container images.

  **This track demonstrates how to:**
    - Provision virtual machine sandbox host using a predefined Compute Engine image
    - Use the Docker daemon on the sandbox host to build and run container images
    - Add check and solve scripts
    - Add simple assets (a Dockerfile) to the sandbox host

          # Learn about Docker
          Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
          Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so
          you can deliver software quickly. Containers run anywhere!

          In this first challenge, you'll create a container image. Please wait while we
          boot a virtual machine for you.
    assignment: |
      Use this command to build a Docker image using the Dockerfile in
      this directory:

      ```
      docker build -t my-service .
      ```

      Did you notice the tab with the source code editor, next to
      the terminal?

          # Starting a container image
          Container images can be started any where a container runtime is installed.
    assignment: |-
      Now that you have built a container image, you can run it.

      ## Step 1
      Run the following command to start the container:
      ```
      docker run --name some-container -p 80:80 -d my-service
      ```

      ## Step 2
      Check the nginx tab (next the the terminal tab) to verify if the container is running.
      You should see a "Welcom to nginx" message

      ## Step 3
      To verify if the container is running using the command line, run this command:
      ```
      docker container ls
      ```
