title: Building on Instruqt with Terraform
teaser: This track shows you how to use Instruqt with Terraform to build cloud resources
  or configure SaaS accounts.
description: |-
  Terraform is a popular open source infrastructure as code tool. Terraform can be used to build infrastructure on any public cloud, and it can also be used to configure many SaaS services.

  This template track covers three use cases:

  1. User runs terraform commands to configure resources in AWS.

  2. User configures a SaaS provider and runs terraform to manage resources on the SaaS platform.

  3. Background setup using terraform that happens before your user logs in. Look in the **track_scripts/setup-workstation** script for an example of terraform that runs during setup.
