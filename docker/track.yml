      # Learn about Docker
      Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure.
      With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage
      your applications.

      # Creating a Docker image
      Creating images with Docker guarantees that the image created will always
      work independently of the OS as long as Docker is installed.
  assignment: |-
    Write or copy and paste the following command to build a Docker image based on the `Dockerfile` located in the `Editor` tab.
    ```
    docker build -t my-service .
    ```
    Once the command has been executed, you can check whether the image was successfully built with the correct name, by clicking `Check`.
    In this example, the Dockerfile only contains a simple image of nginx.

      # How to start a Docker container
      Docker images can be started as containers independent of the platform
      being used as long as Docker is installed.
  assignment: |-
    Now that you have built a Docker image, you can run it in a container. Run the following command to start the container:
    ```
    docker run --name some-container -p 80:80 -d my-service
    ```
    Check the services tab to verify the service is running.

    Congratulations! You have successfully run the container. You can now click `Check` to continue to the next step.

    Once the command has been executed, you can check if the container is running by executing:
    ```
    docker container ls
    ```
    You should see a list of all containers on the vm, one of them should be named `some-container`.
