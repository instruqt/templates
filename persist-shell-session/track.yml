title: Persistent Shell Environments
teaser: Run a service in the background or keep a long-running command going between
  challenges with the GNU screen tool.
description: |-
  Sometimes a track requires users to start a command and leave it running in a terminal window. The problem is when you change challenges the shell environment gets reset, killing your long-running command.

  You can use the [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) tool to persist a running process or shell environment across multiple challenges.
