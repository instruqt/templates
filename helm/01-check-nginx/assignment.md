ðŸ‘€ Verify that Helm is available
================================

Helm has been installed on this virtual machine alongside an NGINX ingress controller Helm chart.

You can check that Helm is available and its version with this command:

```bash
helm version
```

You should get a message with the build info that looks like this:

```
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.7.2", GitCommit:"663a896f4a815053445eec4153677ddc24a0a361", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.16.10"}
```

ðŸš€ The NGINX chart is installed and the pods are running
========================================================

You can use Helm to show all the charts that are installed on this machine. To do this, run this command:

```bash
helm list
```

You will get a message with the ingress-nginx chart information, it should look like this (note that the status should be deployed):

```
NAME                    NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION
my-ingress-nginx        default         1               2022-01-06 16:00:34.622220076 +0000 UTC deployed        ingress-nginx-4.0.13    1.1.0
```

Aditionally, you can check that the NGINX pods are running, remember that Helm works over kubernetes. Just run this command to verify that the NGINX pods are up and running:

```
kubectl get pods
```

This should show you the NGINX controller pods:

```
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
svclb-my-ingress-nginx-controller-fwrxs       2/2     Running   0          3m49s
my-ingress-nginx-controller-b9d8cddf4-gwlgr   1/1     Running   0          3m49s
```
