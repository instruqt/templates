We'll be using the Github provider as an example. The process for configuring other SaaS providers will be similar.

Open the **main.tf** file in your text editor. This file contains the GitHub provider configuration as well as a resource that creates a new git repo. All SaaS and PaaS providers have instructions on how to configure authentication.

<h2 class="cyan">Step 1: Create a Token</h2>
<hr class="cyan">
Create a GitHub Personal Access Token with **repo** permissions. You can follow the instructions on this page to generate your token:

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

<h2 class="cyan">Export the Token</h2>
<hr class="cyan">
Step 2: Export your personal access token into your shell environment:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=yourtokengoeshere
```

<h2 class="cyan">Step 3: Run Terraform</h2>
<hr class="cyan">

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

<h2 class="cyan">Step 4: Confirm Your Work</h2>
<hr class="cyan">

Visit your new repository by replacing `youruser` below with your own GitHub username.
