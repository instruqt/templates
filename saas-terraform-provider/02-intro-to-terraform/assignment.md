In this challenge you'll learn a few basic Terraform commands and a bit about how Terraform works.

## Overview
[Terraform](https://terraform.io) is an open source, infrastructure as code tool for building cloud resources. Terraform works with providers, which handle all of the interactions with various cloud APIs. For example, if you wish to build resources in AWS, you can use the [Terraform provider for AWS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs).

## Terraform Code
Click on the **Text Editor** tab on the left and open the **main.tf** file. This is the code you'll use to build infrastructure. We'll be using the sample Hashicat application for this track.

## Exercises
Let's try a few Terraform commands.

Click on the **Shell** tab and run each of these commands in your shell prompt:

```bash
terraform version
terraform help
terraform init
```

The **terraform init** command downloads any required providers and modules to your workstation. These are stored in the hidden **.terraform** directory.

Nice work. Your Terraform workspace is ready for use.
