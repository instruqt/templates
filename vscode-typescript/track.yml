    ## Step 1
    Click "Explorer" > "NPM Scripts" to open the corresponding panel.
    Run the "test" task from it.

    The tests should run, and you should see the failing one in the terminal panel.

    ## Step 2
    Update the function in src/sum.ts to correctly return the sum.
    At this point you might want to re-run the tests to see whether the fix is helping.

    ## Check
    To complete this track, press **Check**. It will ran the tests and pass if all the tests are passing.
